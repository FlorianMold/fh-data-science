# Exercise 3 - Clustering

In this task, you shall experiment with three clustering techniques of your choice (not necessarily limited to the ones presented in the lecture). You should choose at least one from either hierarchical and partitive techniques.

The datasets will be the same as you used for the first two exercises (if you have some issues with any of them and you deem then not suitable, please let me know, and we can check for alternatives). In addition, you shall use one of the toy datasets provided by the sk-learn framework, to illustrate the different characteristics of the clustering (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_comparison.html)

You shall briefly describe the methods used and the reason behind your choice, and then apply the methods. Describe the results, and what information you can obtain. Specifically, compare the outcomes of the different methods. Contrast your results with what you have seen from the data projection exercise - do you see an "optimal" number of clusters from the data projections, and is that reflected in the clustering outcome? Further, chose two evaluation criteria to compare the algorithms also quantitatively.

As before, the choice of programming language / framework is up to you. It is recommended to use a framework that already provides all the methods that you want to use.
