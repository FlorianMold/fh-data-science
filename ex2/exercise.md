In this task, you shall experiment with three dimensionality reduction techniques of your choice (not necessarily limited to the ones presented in the lecture).

Specifically, you shall work with the two datasets that you selected in Exercise 1. Apply the methods you selected to these dataset, and describe the results from the visualisation, and what information you can read/obtain from the plots. If the methods allow, also try different parameters, or if the method is not deterministic (such as t-SNE), try multiple runs and illustrate the differences.

Then, compare how useful the methods seem to understand the properties of the data set, and contrast that with the information you learned in exercise 1. Summarise your findings (including screenshots / the visualisations) in a report.



The choice of programming language / framework is up to you. It is recommended to use a framework that already provides all the methods that you want to use within the same API, such as Python sk-learn.
